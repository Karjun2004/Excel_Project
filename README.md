# Blinkit Sales Analysis 📊

Hi there! 👋 This is a simple Excel project where I analyzed Blinkit’s sales data to find key insights. I created pivot tables, charts, and an easy-to-follow dashboard so you can quickly understand which products and regions are performing best.

## 📂 What’s Inside
- **BLINKIT_PROJECT.xlsx** – the main Excel file with all the analysis, charts, and tables.

## ✅ What This Project Shows
- How sales are distributed across different product categories and regions.
- Visual trends of which products are selling the most.
- A clear dashboard to help anyone (even without Excel expertise) make sense of the data.

## 🚀 How to Check It Out
1. Download the Excel file from this repository.
2. Open it using Microsoft Excel (2010 or later) or a compatible tool like Google Sheets or LibreOffice.
3. Explore the pivot tables and charts — they’re organized for easy navigation.

## 📝 Why I Built This
I wanted to showcase my Excel skills, including creating dashboards, working with pivot tables, and presenting data in a clear, visual way. I believe this is a great example of how I can turn raw data into actionable insights.
